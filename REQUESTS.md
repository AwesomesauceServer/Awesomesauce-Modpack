# Requests
If you want a mod to be added or a config changed, these are the rules to follow or the request will probably be denied.

Please do not request mods on behalf of other people.

### Add a mod
1. Check if the mod was already reqested, if it has not then make a new [Issue](https://github.com/AwesomesauceServer/Awesomesauce-Modpack/issues).
   * A mod can be re-requested once every 30 days.

2. Only **CurseForge** links are accepted. If the mod is not on CurseForge then do not request it.
